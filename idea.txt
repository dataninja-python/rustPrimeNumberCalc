I'm a weirdo. So, I decided to make this more exciting:

    1. Use emacs to write all my code (I presume this eliminates all the 'cheating' that IDEs typically do. This is a challenge to teach me to be more detail oriented. I do NOT recommend this.)
    2. Write the primary code in Common Lisp
    3. Transpile the code first to Haskell to make sure my mathematic reasoning is sound
    4. Then, if it succeeds, transpile the code to Rust
    5. Compile the final...hopefully more efficient and accurate Rust code as a TUI
